# This function allocates empirial data into 10 folds. Specifically, 
# each fold gets one random trial within a sequence of 10 trials. Therefore,
# each fold contains a subset of trials evenly sampled from the learning process.

# We will conduct 10-fold cross validation afterwards based this allocation.

# Noticeably, we skip the first 5 trials. Since we want to always include the 
# first 5 trials in the training set.
